# numbers in Python has infinite accuracy
# Python interpreter allocates memory automatically so that the int type of
#   infinite accuarcy is possible. A normal int has 4 bytes (just like C and C++)
#   A long int has as many bytes as needed.
# We can force an int to be long int by adding an l/L at its end.
